## About The Project
<br/>
SquadUp is a social networking web service at which it is possible to register as a user, send friend requests (which can be
accepted or rejected by the individual) to other users, create posts, i.e., messages that can be seen by other users in the network. These can include text and
images and can also be "liked" and commented on by other users. The
visibility of the latter is limited to the friends of the author of the post. Anyone
has the ability to view the post will also be able to view the
list of users who have liked and, through a click, access the profile
user of one of them. It will also be possible to create events, which can
be used to organize a wide range of activities, such as parties, conferences, company meetings or trivial outings among friends. Users with special
privileges (particularly the creator and admins) can invite other users
to participate. Each event will have a creation, start and end date and
possibly an image. Events may be public or private,
in the first case visible to all registered users of the social network, otherwise
only to friends of the creator. The social also provides the possibility of creating
user groups, which, like the latter, will be able to events and will enclose the posts of their users. Admins and creator will be able to add,
remove members and make them administrators, edit name, image or
description, while only the one who created the group will be able to delete it. It will be
also possible, through a section of the social, to see on a map the location (updated in real time for those who are online or that had
during the last activity on the social for those offline) of their friends, as well as
one's own. It is also possible to view the last access, if they were not
online, of users. The site also provides a system of notifications generated upon the
occurrence of a number of events such as
<ul>
  <li>Friend request (acceptable by pressing on notification)</li>
  <li>Like a post of your own</li>
  <li>Comment below one's own post</li>
  <li>The publication of a post by one of our friends (clicking on the notification will be possible to view the post itself)</li>
</ul>
